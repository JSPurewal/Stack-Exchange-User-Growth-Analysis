# Stack-Exchange-User-Growth-Analysis
Stack Exchange is an internet forum website that allows users to post and answer questions about a variety of topics. The website releases data every three months that documents users, posts, tags, flags, votes, and a variety of other metrics.

# Data Analysis & Insights
Stack Exchange relies on users of the platform for content through questions and answers. We
hypothesize that users improve as community members as they use the site for longer. Our investigation will test this hypothesis via a triangulation of four experiments. First, we evaluate
the quality of posts over time. Second, the improvement in response time as users post more is
measured. Third, exploration of whether there are any trends in the topics users post about, over
time, is performed. Finally, the connection between time on the site and the awards users receive
is evaluated.
